# VSCode Angular TypeScript & Html Snippets
Visual Studio Code TypeScript and Html snippets and code examples for Angular 2,4,5,6, 7 & 8 Beta. 

All code snippets are based on and follow the Angular style guide https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html

The source for the snippets come from:
* https://angular.io/
* https://material.angular.io/
* https://github.com/angular/flex-layout
* https://github.com/ngrx/platform
* https://github.com/ngxs
* https://jestjs.io

and most of all, none of this would exist without the help of all the contributers for fixing, enhancing, testing and making suggestions.

# Important
This extension is optimized for developers that use Angular and are no longer using AngularJS (Angular 1).
If you type in AngularJS keywords, it will suggest an Angular solutions. 
This is by design and meant to help developers learn how AngularJS concepts and techniques map to Angular.

See example below for ng-repeat and ng-click:
